## Summary
The results seem to show that there is a bias towards favorable reviews amongst users of the Vine program. However, it should be noted that the sample size for Vine reviews is significantly smaller than that of regular users. While these results do back the hypothesis, further analysis can and should be done on other Amazon review datasets to see if they give similar results.
